# gitmulti

`gitmulti` is a lightweight CLI utility written in C++ that helps you easily manage multiple `git remote` push targets ‚Äî for example, pushing to both a personal GitHub repo and a university-hosted Git server at the same time.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Adds a secondary remote (e.g., university Git server) based on folder or project name.
- Supports automatic push to both GitHub and a secondary remote.
- Creates a default configuration on first launch.
- Opens config in Notepad (on Windows) or offers to edit in nano (on Linux).
- Smart detection of existing remotes to avoid duplication.
- Windows installer with optional MinGW auto-setup.
- Unix installation script included.

## üîß Installation

### Windows

- Copy the binary to `Program Files\gitmulti\`
- Add it to your system `PATH`
- (Optionally) install MinGW for compiling

### Linux/macOS

Use the provided shell script:

```bash
sudo ./install-unix.sh
```

This will install the binary to `/usr/local/bin/gitmulti`.
And optionally install clang llvm for you on macos on request

## üöÄ Usage

From within any Git-tracked project folder:

```bash
gitmulti
```

You can also manually specify a custom remote URL:

```bash
gitmulti git@custom.git.server:user/project.git
```


## üõ† Configuration

On first launch, a config file is created at:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<You>\.gitmulti_config`
- **Unix**: `~/.gitmulti_config`

Example:

```ini
remote_name=uni
branch=main
default_url=git@uni.example.edu:user/
```

The actual project name is inferred from the current folder name.
